# BEAT

## To clone 
* TODO: determine IDE & Language
* I will need to add you as a collaborator to this repo
* Cloning url `https://github.com/DxExWxExY/BEAT.git` <em> We'll most likely use PyCharm & Python but its subject to change </em>
* <strong> WE WON'T USE CLI GIT </strong>

## Workflow
* We will be utilizing branches to add features to the system
* We will make pull (kind of) to merge into master
* Tasks will be assigned and each will have its own branch (for ease of merging and tracking)
* <strong> If you're stuck please let us know so that we can help you </strong>
